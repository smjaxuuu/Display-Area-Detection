# Display Area Detection for Imperceptible Display Camera Communication

Dataset for the paper "A Reliable and Unobtrusive Approach to Display Area Detection for Imperceptible Display Camera Communication" (yet unpublished) in Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation.

The dataset consists of 300 still images and 6 videos with various displays and image content. Each dataset is repeated for three methods compared in the paper, namely with the proposed display localization marker (DLM), the QR finder pattern and without any pattern/marker.

The ground truth coordinates of the display vertices for each image/video set were manually annotated and stored in the corresponding .txt files. The order of the vertices is top left (x,y), top right (x,y), bottom right (x,y) and bottom left (x,y).

In the future, the source code of the proposed display area detector with DLM may also be uploaded.
